Overall Algorithm:

One "Bank" Data Structure
- Holds up to 20 accounts, no more than that
- Handles user client connections
- Sends error/confirmation messages for each user request

The "Client"
- Cannot open a new account if in a customer session
- Can open a new account otherwise ^^
- Any 'operations' on the account require a 'customer session'
